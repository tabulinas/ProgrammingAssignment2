## There is file with pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation 
## and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special object
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
         m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}
